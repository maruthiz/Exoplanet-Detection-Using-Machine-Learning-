# Exoplanet-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-
Developed a machine learning-based system for the automated detection and classification of exoplanets using data obtained through the Transit Method. This system is capable of processing large datasets of stellar light curves and accurately distinguishing between stars with exoplanets and those without.
